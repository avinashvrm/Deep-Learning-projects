Built a model for Traffic Sign Detection using Convolution Neural Network(CNN) to classify 43 different
classes of the traffic sign. Worked on Dataset provided by GTSRB(The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark).
Used TensorFlow and Keras for implementation purposes and PIL for handling dataset, A recall score of
0.95 was achieved on test set.
